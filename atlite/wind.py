def extrapolate_wind_speed(ds, model, from_height, to_height, from_height2=None):
    """Extrapolate the wind speed from a given height above ground to another.

    If ds already contains a key refering to wind speeds at the desired to_height,
    no conversion is done and the wind speeds are directly returned.

    Extrapolation of the wind speed follows the logarithmic law as desribed in [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xarray.Dataset
        Dataset containing the wind speed time-series at 'from_height' with key
        'wnd{height:d}m' and the surface orography with key 'roughness' at the
        geographic locations of the wind speeds.
    from_height : int
        Height (m) from which the wind speeds are extrapolated to 'to_height'.
        If "None", the closest height to 'to_height' is selected.
    to_height : int|float
        Height (m) to which the wind speeds are extrapolated to.
    model : str
        Model used for the wind speed extrapolation to hub height (either "with_roughness" or "without_roughness")
    from_height2 : int
        (Optional)
        Second height (m) from which the wind speeds are extrapolated to 'to_height'.
        If not provided, two closest heights to 'to_height' are selected from available wind speed heights.

    Returns
    -------
    da : xarray.DataArray
        DataArray containing the extrapolated wind speeds. Name of the DataArray
        is 'wnd{to_height:d}'.
